Rails Starter App
===========

This is a starter web application based on the following technology stack:

* Ruby 2.0
* Rails 4.0.0
* PostgreSQL / Local SQLite
* AngularJS
* Resque-Scheduler
* RSpec
* Twitter Bootstrap (w/ Flatstrap + SASS)
* OmniAuth with strategies for Twitter & Facebook

I'll try to keep this updated with whatever is hot in the community, but
then I might not be using Rails.

```Gemfile``` also contains a set of useful gems for performance, security, api building...

Lots of low-hanging fruit in making this better, PR at will. Will probably accept.
